void CCamera::RotateView(float angle, float x, float y, float z)
{
	CVector3 vNewView;
	CVector3 vView;	

	// Get our view vector (The direciton we are facing)
	vView.x = m_vView.x - m_vPosition.x;		// This gets the direction of the X	
	vView.y = m_vView.y - m_vPosition.y;		// This gets the direction of the Y
	vView.z = m_vView.z - m_vPosition.z;		// This gets the direction of the Z

	// Now that we have a view vector stored in the CVector3 "vView", we can rotate it.
	// This function will be called when we want to move the camera LEFT and RIGHT.
	// So, we need to rotate our view around our position.  Think about it like this:
	// Say we we are standing in one place looking forward.  We are looking in a
	// direction right?  Well, if we rotate our head LEFT or RIGHT, our view changes.
	// Our position does not change... just what we are looking at.  That is why
	// we are just changing m_vView because that is where we are looking.  We want
	// to rotate m_vView around m_vPosition in a circular fashion to simulate this.
	// To rotate something, we want to use sine and cosine.  We need to include
	// math.h in order to use the sin() and cos() functions.
	//
	// To do our camera rotations from now on, we will be using Axis-Angle
	// rotations.  I must warn you that the equations to calculate this
	// rotation isn't intuitive, but isn't a lot of code.  An axis-angle rotation
	// allows us to rotate a point in space around an arbitrary axis.  That means
	// we can take our view point (m_vView) and rotate around our position 
	// (m_vPosition), in any direction.  This is going to come in handy when we
	// get to moving the camera's view by the mouse.  Since the explanation behind
	// the math is larger than I want to write, I suggest checking out Paul Bourke's
	// page for a decent explanation of the math involved:  
	// http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/rotate/

	// Calculate the sine and cosine of the angle once
	float cosTheta = (float)cos(angle);
	float sinTheta = (float)sin(angle);

	// Find the new x position for the new rotated point
	vNewView.x  = (cosTheta + (1 - cosTheta) * x * x)		* vView.x;
	vNewView.x += ((1 - cosTheta) * x * y - z * sinTheta)	* vView.y;
	vNewView.x += ((1 - cosTheta) * x * z + y * sinTheta)	* vView.z;

	// Find the new y position for the new rotated point
	vNewView.y  = ((1 - cosTheta) * x * y + z * sinTheta)	* vView.x;
	vNewView.y += (cosTheta + (1 - cosTheta) * y * y)		* vView.y;
	vNewView.y += ((1 - cosTheta) * y * z - x * sinTheta)	* vView.z;

	// Find the new z position for the new rotated point
	vNewView.z  = ((1 - cosTheta) * x * z - y * sinTheta)	* vView.x;
	vNewView.z += ((1 - cosTheta) * y * z + x * sinTheta)	* vView.y;
	vNewView.z += (cosTheta + (1 - cosTheta) * z * z)		* vView.z;

	// Now we just add the newly rotated vector to our position to set
	// our new rotated view of our camera.
	m_vView.x = m_vPosition.x + vNewView.x;
	m_vView.y = m_vPosition.y + vNewView.y;
	m_vView.z = m_vPosition.z + vNewView.z;

//
// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// Now we have a camera function that allows us to rotate around a certain axis.
// If we want to rotate the opposite direction we just pass in a negative speed.
// You can see this done in CheckForMovement() in main.cpp.
// 
// The next tutorial will focus a bit more on the camera, but more on adding to the
// CVector3 class.  Now that we are moving on, we need more math functions.
